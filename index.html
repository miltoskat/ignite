<a id="ignite" class="anchor" href="#ignite" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ignite.</h3>

<p>Ignite is a fully anonymous <strong>end-to-end</strong> encrypted online platform based on the idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging">OTR Messaging Platform</a>. Initialy we started with this idea because we saw the impact the FBI vs Apple legal case had on cryptography as a whole and we saw the desperate need the common person today have for privacy.</p>

<a id="no-installation-needed" class="anchor" href="#no-installation-needed" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>No Installation Needed</h3>

<p>Ignite utilises a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography in order to achieve maximum security,it is based on a combination of AES symmetric-key algorithm with 128 bits key length, the Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange with 1536 bits group size, and the SHA-1 hash function.</p>

<a id="file-sharing" class="anchor" href="#file-sharing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>File-Sharing</h3>

<p>Ignite let's you create a timed peer-to-peer link in order to share your files with friends safely and private. After the file has been downloaded there will be a small time frame in which the user will be able to initialise another install before the link gets deleted for ever from our servers</p>
