							<h3>The Third Thing</h3>
							<p>In order to compete with already existing peer-to-peer encryption based IM applications we had to redefine decetralized. A website is by design centered on a server, so what we did is appart from the client-side encryption we immediatelly delete the messages from the server and overwrite them with other messages from other clients.</p>

							<h3>tech specs</h3>
							<!--<p>This is the subtitle for this particular heading</p>-->
						</header>
						<p>Ignite utilises a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography in order to achieve maximum security,it is based on a combination of <strong>AES</strong> symmetric-key algorithm with <strong>128 bits </strong>key length, the 
                        <strong>Diffieâ€“Hellman</strong> key exchange with 1536 bits group size, and the <strong>SHA-1</strong> hash function.

							<h3>Connecting with people</h3>
						</header>
						<blockquote>There are two ways to connect with people you know the typical connect with facebook one, and our new anonymous approach which involves scanning your friend's qr codes or personal generated hashes.</blockquote>
					</section>
					<section>
						<header>
							<h3>File sharing</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Ignite supports a brand new way of peer to peer sharing! All you have to do is choose the file you want to share and Ignite will create a torrent link to share with your friends, but the difference is that after the file is downloaded there is a certain time frame in which the download can be initiated again, after that the link gets permanently deleted.</p>
						<hr />
						<p>That feature is making Ignite perfect for business clients and large companies that are concerned about the privacy of the files they share.</p>
