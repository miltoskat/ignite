  "body": "### Ignite.\r\nIgnite is a fully anonymous **end-to-end** encrypted online platform based on the idea of the [OTR Messaging Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging). Initialy we started with this idea because we saw the impact the FBI vs Apple legal case had on cryptography as a whole and we saw the desperate need the common person today have for privacy.\r\n\r\n### No Installation Needed\r\nBuilt on free online platforms that support every browser.\r\n\r\n### Based on the safest Encryption methods\r\nIgnite utilises a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography in order to achieve maximum security,it is based on a combination of AES symmetric-key algorithm with 128 bits key length, the Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange with 1536 bits group size, and the SHA-1 hash function.\r\n\r\n### File-Sharing\r\nIgnite let's you create a timed peer-to-peer link in order to share your files with friends safely and private. After the file has been downloaded there will be a small time frame in which the user will be able to initialise another install before the link gets deleted for ever from our servers\r\n\r\n### Finding People\r\nThere are 2 ways to find someone to communicate either by scanning their personal QR code or by using their personal generated hash.\r\n\r\n### Pricing\r\nIgnite is **free**, our funding comes from [Brave](https://www.brave.com) approved advertisements.",
